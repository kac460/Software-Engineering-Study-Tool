Reducing the development cost is one of the advantages of using a customized software product. 

 ------
A Use Case diagram is usually used to show the structure of the system. 

 ------
The following statement is a non-functional requirement for security control: "The system shall only allow registered customers to browse their order history." 

 ------
If you don't validate the requirements with the customers, it may cost up to 100 times more just to fix the error after the delivery. 

 ------
Software design and implementation focus only on the problem domain. 

 ------
Throwaway prototypes are usually developed at the system design phase. 

 ------
Non-functional requirements are the services the software system should provide. 

 ------
The A in the SMART is the abbreviation for Attainable, an attribute for evaluating requirement statements. 

 ------
Domain requirements are the constraints on the software system from the solution domain.

Software Engineering is a discipline in which the focus is on the realization of computer solvable problems. 

 ------
Functional requirements are usually the statements of the quality attributes that the software must meet. 

 ------
The following requirement statement is SMART. "The report will be available soon after month-end close." 

 ------
Use cases are a scenario-based technique for requirement elicitation. 

 ------
A throw-away prototype is an early working version of the deliverable. 

 ------
Incremental development is most appropriate for small and medium-sized software project. 

 ------
Although there are multiple solutions to a software project, the solutions might not be practical since we always have certain degree of constraints in developing software, such as budget and time. 

 ------
To shorten the delivery times for large and complex system, compromising system quality is acceptable. 

 ------
Air traffic control systems are good examples of customized software products. 

 ------
It is possible that CASE tools have extensive automation and take over creative design from the engineers. 

 ------
There is no single 'ideal' approach to software engineering, therefore, we don't need a diversity of approaches to software development. 

 ------
In incremental/iterative software development, an early increment of the system normally delivers low-priority functionality. 

 ------
In a fast-paced business environment, the problem of using the waterfall model to develop the software is that the system design or implementation has to be reworked once the requirements change. 

 ------
The notion of "Software Engineering" was first proposed in 1968 at a conference held to discuss the "software crisis". 

 ------
System requirements should describe the system services in detail. 

 ------
The following non-functional requirement is measurable: "The system shall process 2 transactions per second." 

 ------
SMART is a specific set of attributes that every requirement statement can be measured against. 

 ------
Requirement validation is concerned with demonstrating that the requirements define the system that the customers really want. 

 ------
UML is a diagram to show the architectural design of the software. 

 ------
One of the three advantages of explicitly designing and documenting a software architecture is it can be used as a focus for discussion by a range of different stakeholders. 

 ------
Client/Server architecture can potentially save hardware cost. 

 ------
"has", "is composed of" in part of speech identifies the generalization model component in a class diagram. 

 ------
The manageability of a distributed system architecture is better than a centralized system architecture. 

 ------
If performance is a critical requirement, the architecture should be designed to have fine-grain components, and the subsystems should constantly communicate with each other. 

 ------
The last step of UI design process is interface evaluation. 

 ------
Fault-tolerant system architecture should be used if maintainability is a critical requirement. 

 ------
ATM (Auto Teller Machine) is a client/server architecture. 

 ------
The repository architecture is a system model where the system is organized as a set of services. 

 ------
Cohesion measures dependency among subsystems. 

 ------
Use case diagram is normally used at both the analysis and design phase. 

 ------
Localizing safety-related features improves performance. 

 ------
The notation for generalization in a class diagram is a large empty arrow pointing from the superclass to the subclass. 

 ------
Object communication is through message passing. 

 ------
The layered pattern supports the incremental development of systems. 

 ------
"has", "is composed of" in part of speech identifies the aggregation model component in a class diagram. 

 ------
MVC pattern supports presentation of the same data in different ways. 

 ------
The product of the architectural design process is an architectural model that describes how the system is organized as a set of communicating components. 

 ------
"is a", "is kind of" in part of speech identifies the aggregation model component in a class diagram. 

 ------
Architectural design is the critical link between design and requirements engineering. 

 ------
Client/server architecture supports resource sharing. 

 ------
There is no overlap between the processes of requirement engineering and architectural design. 

 ------
Introducing redundant data improves availability but makes security more difficult. 

 ------
In OO design, control objects coordinate boundary objects and entity objects. 

 ------
Sequence diagram represents the interactions among a set of objects during a single use case. 

 ------
"Keeping the software current with the operating systems" is a corrective maintenance task. 

 ------
Software testing involves running an implementation of the software with test data. 

 ------
One of the disadvantages of having the developers maintaining the software is the new system development often gets a higher priority than maintenance. 

 ------
Rerunning an existing set of tests is called regression testing. 

 ------
Software engineers shall act in a manner that is in the best interests of their client and employer, consistent with the public interest. 

 ------
White-box testing requires test oracle. 

 ------
An advantage of incremental development is that a testable version of the system is available at a fairly early stage. 

 ------
Unless additional work is done to explicitly reduce the complexity of a system, the system will become increasingly ore complex due to maintenance-related changes. 

 ------
We need to rerun all tests after each defect repair. 

 ------
One of the advantages of having a separate maintainers is there will be better documentations. 

 ------
In bottom-up integration testing, you don't need stubs. 

 ------
Requirement analysis document is required in order to perform system testing. 

 ------
Ideally, regression testing should re-run all test cases, but it's impractical because of the cost. 

 ------
Software engineers shall act consistently with the public interest. 

 ------
In integration testing, a driver is the additional code written to simulate the component being called by the component being tested. 

 ------
Static source code analyzers can detect uninitialized variables, but they cannot detect incorrect initializations. 

 ------
You can only use a dynamic approach to test a system when a prototype or an executable version of the program is available. 

 ------
Debugging is a process to establish the existence of defects in a software system. 

 ------
White-box testing is structural testing. 

 ------
Software inspections or peer reviews analyze and check system representations such as requirements document, design diagrams and the source code. 

 ------
Software engineers shall participate in lifelong learning regarding the practice of their profession and shall promote an ethical approach to the practice of the profession. 

 ------
Black-box testing is simply concerned with demonstrating that the system does or does not work properly. 

 ------
Verification and Validation starts with requirement reviews and continues through design reviews and code inspections to product testing. 

 ------
The quality attribute Maintainability is the ease with which maintenance can be carried out. 

 ------
In bottom-up integration testing, you don't need drivers.
