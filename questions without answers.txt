Reducing the development cost is one of the advantages of using a customized software product. 

 ------
A Use Case diagram is usually used to show the structure of the system. 

 ------
The following statement is a non-functional requirement for security control: "The system shall only allow registered customers to browse their order history." 

 ------
If you don't validate the requirements with the customers, it may cost up to 100 times more just to fix the error after the delivery. 

 ------
Software design and implementation focus only on the problem domain. 

 ------
Throwaway prototypes are usually developed at the system design phase. 

 ------
Non-functional requirements are the services the software system should provide. 

 ------
The A in the SMART is the abbreviation for Attainable, an attribute for evaluating requirement statements. 

 ------
Domain requirements are the constraints on the software system from the solution domain. 

 ------
In Scrum, the Scrum Master is the one interfaces with the customers. 

 ------
Real-time embedded software usually requires more extensive validation and testing than web-based systems. 

 ------
The M in the SMART is the abbreviation for Measurable, an attribute for evaluating requirement statements. 

 ------
The fixed-length iterations in Scrum is called a phase. 

 ------
Software efficiency includes responsiveness, processing time and memory utilization. 

 ------
The first step in the requirement engineering process is conducting the requirement analysis. 

 ------
There are no universal software engineering methods or techniques suitable for all software systems. 

 ------
In Scrum, the sprint backlog items are estimated with story points. 

 ------
The T in the SMART is the abbreviation for Transformable, an attribute for evaluating requirement statements. 

 ------
The A in the SMART is the abbreviation for Accountable, an attribute for evaluating requirement statements. 

 ------
Requirement reviews is usually done manually with the customers and contractors. 

 ------
The T in the SMART is the abbreviation for Traceable, an attribute for evaluating requirement statements. 

 ------
Agile development methods aim to reduce the delivery time for working software systems. 

 ------
The best approach to develop a real-time embedded software system is go Agile. 

 ------
Software specification focuses only on the user's view of the system. 

 ------
Software Engineering is a discipline in which the focus is on the realization of computer solvable problems. 

 ------
Functional requirements are usually the statements of the quality attributes that the software must meet. 

 ------
The following requirement statement is SMART. "The report will be available soon after month-end close." 

 ------
Use cases are a scenario-based technique for requirement elicitation. 

 ------
A throw-away prototype is an early working version of the deliverable. 

 ------
Incremental development is most appropriate for small and medium-sized software project. 

 ------
Although there are multiple solutions to a software project, the solutions might not be practical since we always have certain degree of constraints in developing software, such as budget and time. 

 ------
To shorten the delivery times for large and complex system, compromising system quality is acceptable. 

 ------
Air traffic control systems are good examples of customized software products. 

 ------
It is possible that CASE tools have extensive automation and take over creative design from the engineers. 

 ------
There is no single 'ideal' approach to software engineering, therefore, we don't need a diversity of approaches to software development. 

 ------
In incremental/iterative software development, an early increment of the system normally delivers low-priority functionality. 

 ------
In a fast-paced business environment, the problem of using the waterfall model to develop the software is that the system design or implementation has to be reworked once the requirements change. 

 ------
The notion of "Software Engineering" was first proposed in 1968 at a conference held to discuss the "software crisis". 

 ------
System requirements should describe the system services in detail. 

 ------
The following non-functional requirement is measurable: "The system shall process 2 transactions per second." 

 ------
SMART is a specific set of attributes that every requirement statement can be measured against. 

 ------
Requirement validation is concerned with demonstrating that the requirements define the system that the customers really want. 

 ------
UML is a diagram to show the architectural design of the software.
